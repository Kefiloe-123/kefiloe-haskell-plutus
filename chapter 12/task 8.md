HC12T8: Merge Two Sorted Lists

```haskell
-- This program defines a function mergeLists that merges two sorted lists.
-- It tests the function in the main using example inputs.

-- Function to merge two sorted lists into one sorted list
mergeLists :: Ord a => [a] -> [a] -> [a]
mergeLists [] ys = ys
mergeLists xs [] = xs
mergeLists (x:xs) (y:ys)
    | x < y     = x : mergeLists xs (y:ys)
    | otherwise = y : mergeLists (x:xs) ys

-- Main function to demonstrate usage
main :: IO ()
main = do
    putStrLn "Merging [1,3,5,7] and [2,4,6,8]..."
    let list1 = [1,3,5,7]
    let list2 = [2,4,6,8]
    let merged = mergeLists list1 list2
    putStrLn "Result:"
    print merged
```
