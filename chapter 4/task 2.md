HC4T2 - Task 2: Define a dayType Function

```haskell
-- Function to classify a day as a weekend, weekday, or invalid
dayType :: String -> String
dayType "Saturday" = "It's a weekend!"
dayType "Sunday"   = "It's a weekend!"
dayType "Monday"   = "It's a weekday."
dayType "Tuesday"  = "It's a weekday."
dayType "Wednesday"= "It's a weekday."
dayType "Thursday" = "It's a weekday."
dayType "Friday"   = "It's a weekday."
dayType _          = "Invalid day"

-- Main function to test dayType
main :: IO ()
main = do
    putStrLn ("dayType \"Saturday\": " ++ dayType "Saturday")
    putStrLn ("dayType \"Monday\": " ++ dayType "Monday")
    putStrLn ("dayType \"Funday\": " ++ dayType "Funday")
```
